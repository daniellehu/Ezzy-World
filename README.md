# Ezzy-World
15-112 Term Project (Fall 2014) -- Sims-like game, but cuter (also buggier)

Set-Up:
Download the zip folder and unzip with all of the content inside. Run the file "Ezzy World.py" through a Python IDE.
Hitting run should simply start the game as long as all of the animations from the unzipped file are still where they were.
